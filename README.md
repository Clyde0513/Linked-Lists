# Linked-Lists
Practice using linked-list, such as circular or doubly, on a number of sets

# Sets
This set can be anything in a form of primitive types -- from a set of int, strings, etc
This Project uses a linked-list to traverse through a Set to do insertion, removal, to get an item from the set, and to see if an element is in the Set
